# Instructions for developing `rill.yaml`

## Introduction

`rill.yaml` is a required configuration file located at the root of every Rill project. It defines project-wide settings, similar to `package.json` in Node.js or `dbt_project.yml` in dbt.

## Core Concepts

### Project metadata

There are no required properties in `rill.yaml`, but it is common to configure:

- `display_name`: Human-readable name shown in the UI
- `description`: Brief description of the project's purpose
- `compiler`: Deprecated property that is commonly found in old projects

### Default OLAP connector

The `olap_connector` property sets the default OLAP database for the project. Models output to this connector by default, and metrics views query from it unless explicitly overridden.

Common values are `duckdb` or `clickhouse`. If not specified, Rill initializes a managed DuckDB database and uses it as the default OLAP connector. 

### Mock users for security testing

The `mock_users` property defines test users for validating security policies during local development. Each mock user can have:

- `email` (required): The user's email address
- `name`: Display name
- `admin`: Boolean indicating admin privileges
- `groups`: List of group memberships
- Custom attributes for use in security policy expressions

When mock users are defined and security policies exist, a "View as" dropdown appears in the dashboard preview.

### Environment variables

The `env` property sets default values for non-sensitive variables. These can be referenced in resource files using templating syntax (`{{ .env.<variable> }}`). Sensitive secrets should go in `.env` instead.

### Resource type defaults

Project-wide defaults can be set for resource types using plural keys:

- `models`: Default settings for all models (e.g., refresh schedules)
- `metrics_views`: Default settings for all metrics views (e.g., `first_day_of_week`)
- `explores`: Default settings for explore dashboards (e.g., `time_ranges`, `time_zones`)
- `canvases`: Default settings for canvas dashboards

Individual resources can override these defaults.

### Path management

- `ignore_paths`: List of paths to exclude from parsing (use leading `/`)
- `public_paths`: List of paths to expose over HTTP (defaults to `['./public']`)

### Environment overrides

The `dev` and `prod` properties allow environment-specific configuration overrides.

## JSON Schema

Here is a full JSON schema for the `rill.yaml` syntax:

        In `rill.yaml`, project-wide defaults can be specified for a resource type within a project. Unless otherwise specified, _individual resources will inherit any defaults_ that have been specified in `rill.yaml`. For available properties that can be configured, please refer to the YAML specification for each individual resource type - [model](models.md), [metrics_view](metrics-views.md), and [explore](explore-dashboards.md)

        :::note Use plurals when specifying project-wide defaults
        In your `rill.yaml`, the top level property for the resource type needs to be **plural**, such as `models`, `metrics_views` and `explores`.
        :::

        :::info Hierarchy of inheritance and property overrides
        As a general rule of thumb, properties that have been specified at a more _granular_ level will supercede or override higher level properties that have been inherited. Therefore, in order of inheritance, Rill will prioritize properties in the following order:
        1. Individual [models](models.md)/[metrics_views](metrics-views.md)/[explore](explore-dashboards.md) object level properties (e.g. `models.yaml` or `explore-dashboards.yaml`)
        2. [Environment](/developers/build/models/templating) level properties (e.g. a specific property that have been set for `dev`)
        3. [Project-wide defaults](#project-wide-defaults) for a specific property and resource type

        The public_paths and ignore_paths properties in the rill.yaml file provide control over which files and directories are processed or exposed by Rill. The public_paths property defines a list of file or directory paths to expose over HTTP. By default, it includes ['./public']. The ignore_paths property specifies a list of files or directories that Rill excludes during ingestion and parsing. This prevents unnecessary or incompatible content from affecting the project.

        Don't forget the leading `/` when specifying the path for `ignore_paths` and this path is also assuming the relative path from your project root.
