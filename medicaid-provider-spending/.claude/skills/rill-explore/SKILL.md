# Instructions for developing an explore dashboard in Rill

## Introduction

Explore dashboards are resources that configure an interactive, drill-down dashboard for a metrics view. They are Rill's default dashboard type, designed for explorative slice-and-dice analysis of a single metrics view.

Explore dashboards are lightweight resources that sit downstream of a metrics view in the project DAG. Their reconcile logic is fast (validation only), so they can be created and modified freely without performance concerns.

### When to use explores vs canvases

- **Explore dashboards:** Best for explorative analysis, drill-down investigations, and letting users freely slice data by any dimension.
- **Canvas dashboards:** Best for fixed reports, executive summaries, or combining multiple metrics views into a single view.

## Development approach

Explore dashboards require minimal configuration. In most cases, you only need to:

1. Reference the metrics view
2. Select which dimensions and measures to expose (usually all, indicated by `'*'`)
3. Optionally configure defaults and time ranges

**Best practice:** Keep explore configurations simple. Only add advanced features (security policies, custom themes, restricted dimensions) when there is a clear requirement. The metrics view already defines the business logic; the explore just controls presentation and access.

## Inline explores in metrics views

Metrics views create an explore resource by default with the same name as the metrics view. For legacy reasons, this does not happen for metrics views containing `version: 1`. You can customize a metrics view's explore with the `explore:` property inside the metrics view file:

```yaml
# metrics/sales.yaml
type: metrics_view
display_name: Sales Analytics

model: sales_model
timeseries: order_date

dimensions:
  - column: region
  - column: product_category

measures:
  - name: total_revenue
    expression: SUM(revenue)

# Inline explore configuration (optional)
explore:
  time_ranges:
    - P7D
    - P30D
    - P90D
  defaults:
    time_range: P30D
```

Use inline explores for simple cases where you want to keep the metrics view and its dashboard configuration together. Use separate explore files when you need multiple explores for the same metrics view or more complex configurations.

## Example with annotations

Note that most explore dashboards work great without any of the optional properties shown here.

```yaml
# dashboards/sales_explore.yaml

# Required: resource type
type: explore

# Required: the metrics view this dashboard renders
metrics_view: sales_metrics

# Optional: display name shown in the navigation and header
display_name: "Sales Performance"

# Optional: informational banner at the top of the dashboard
banner: "Data refreshes daily at 6 AM UTC"

# Optional: which dimensions to expose (use '*' for all)
dimensions: '*'

# Optional: which measures to expose (use '*' for all)
measures: '*'

# Optional: customize the time range dropdown
time_ranges:
  - P7D
  - P30D
  - P90D
  - P12M
  - rill-MTD
  - rill-YTD

# Optional: default dashboard state on first load
defaults:
  time_range: P30D
  comparison_mode: time

# Optional: pin specific time zones to the top of the selector
time_zones:
  - America/Los_Angeles
  - America/New_York

# Optional: custom theme
theme: my_theme

# Optional: restrict access to specific users.
# Note: usually you should do this in the metrics view, not the explore resource.
security:
  access: "{{ .user.admin }} OR '{{ .user.email }}' LIKE '%@example.com'"
```

## Minimal example

For most use cases, a minimal explore is sufficient:

```yaml
type: explore
metrics_view: sales_metrics
display_name: "Sales Dashboard"
dimensions: '*'
measures: '*'
```
